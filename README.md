# CyTix

A mobile app created as a school project in a group of 3. I wrote the backend/ database and 2 other students wrote the front end. We made this a few years ago, I'm just uploading it now. It is a ticketing system for events. A user can create events and then create tickets for events and assign people to check tickets. The tickets are presented on one phone and validated with a code sent to the backend on a "checkers'" phone. Uses a MySQL database and Spring to handle the backend.
